<h1>Safwan's Favortite Quran Verses</h1>

<h2>My top 3 verses as of July 2023</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Surah Ar-Rahman [55:13]</h3>

<p>"Then which of your Lordâ€™s favours will you both deny?" </p>

<p>
    This verse just now reminds me that Allah is capable of ALL things, so when I make dua I should be confident that Allah will hear my dua and I should 
    reflect on the answer to that dua and regardless of the outcome still be grateful.
</p>

<h3>Surah Ar-Rahman [55:60]</h3>

<p>"Is the reward for good anything but good?" </p>

<p>
    This verse really resonates with me. I always struggled with "pettiness" and reading this verse remindes me that Allah will always reward me for doing good,
    the world may or may not, however The Most Beneficient will!
</p>

<h3>Surah Gahfir [40:58] </h3>

<p>"Those blind and those who can see are not equal, nor are those who believe and do good to those who do evil. Yet you are hardly mindful." </p>

<p> 
    There is so much to unpack in this verse, what I took is if I want to change the world for the sake of Allah I need my "vision", Allah
    blessed me with "vision" for a reason! 
</p>
