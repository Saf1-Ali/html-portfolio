<h1>Safwan's Movie Ratings</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies as of July 2023</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Godfather Part II</h3>

<p>Italian mob bosses, good plot, and a badass male lead </p>

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

<p>One of the best, if not the best, super hero film of all-time. Action, suspense, and also a good plot </p>

<h3>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</h3>

<p>An absolute OG Bollywood film that takes me back to my child hood. Funny, romantic, and of course lots of drama </p>
