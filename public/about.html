  I absolutley love talking to and learning from my users and emapthizing with their journeys'. It excites me to be able to express 
  my creativty through desigining delightful and engaging digital expereinces. And I appreciate how results come through a constant 
  loop of feedback and itteration. Design started out as a passion but quickly came to teach me invaluable life lessons.
